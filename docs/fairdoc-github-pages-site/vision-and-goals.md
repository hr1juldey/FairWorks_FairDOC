# üéØ Vision & Goals

## Vision
To democratize healthcare expertise through an AI-assisted triage and diagnostic support network that connects patients with the right care at the right time, while ensuring fairness, transparency, and robust human oversight. Healthcare should be a human right, not a privilege; technology should bridge gaps, not create them; AI should amplify human compassion, not replace it.

## Goals
* **Bridge Healthcare Gaps:** Offer a readily accessible, baseline triage service via ubiquitous chat platforms, aiming to reduce preventable emergency visits, alleviate pressure on primary care, and improve outcomes from unnecessary in-person consultations, especially for underserved populations (e.g., addressing longer wait times for ethnic minorities and lack of specialist access for rural patients).
* **Promote Evidence-Based Care:** Implement and continuously update triage and diagnostic support logic based on NICE Clinical Guidelines (e.g., CG95 for chest pain, CG108), MoHFW India protocols, and other credible medical sources for consistent and reliable decision support.
* **Enable Health System Innovation:** Provide a robust suite of APIs and SDKs to empower telemedicine startups, hospitals, public health agencies, and other third-party applications to integrate Fairdoc‚Äôs triage, diagnostic support, and anonymized data services into their offerings.
* **Ensure Sustainability & Public Good:** Operate primarily as a non-profit public utility. Funding will be sought through government grants, philanthropic contributions, minimal transaction fees for premium services, and value-added services for institutional partners, modeled after ONDC/UPI funding strategies.
* **Champion Responsible AI:** Maintain ethical AI principles, including continuous bias monitoring and mitigation (addressing diagnostic bias against ethnicity, gender, age), data privacy, and ensuring human-in-the-loop for all critical medical decisions.
