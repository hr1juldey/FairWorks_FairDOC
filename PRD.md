## 1\. üöÄ Overview

Fairdoc AI is an open-source **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** for healthcare, initially focusing on the **UK and India**. It's designed to provide secure, scalable, and interoperable medical triage and diagnostic support services via familiar messaging interfaces like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram, as well as a dedicated web UI.

Inspired by the success of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) in India, Fairdoc aims to create a healthcare equivalent‚Äîthe **Unified Health Interface (UHI)**. This platform will:

  * ‚öñÔ∏è Provide **equitable access** to initial medical triage for all citizens, regardless of their geographical location or socioeconomic status.
  * üè• Promote **clinical best practices** by integrating established guidelines like NICE protocols in the UK and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) / Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) standards in India.
  * üåê Foster an **ecosystem of innovation** by offering open APIs and SDKs for third-party developers, hospitals, insurance providers, pharmaceutical companies, and diagnostic services.
  * üíæ Operate under **open-source governance** (MIT License), promoting transparency, community collaboration, and rapid iteration.

This document outlines the requirements for Fairdoc AI, with a particular focus on developing a **v0 prototype within a 10-hour sprint** to demonstrate core triage functionality for a patient presenting with chest pain.

## 2\. üéØ Vision & Goals

### Vision

To democratize healthcare expertise through an AI-assisted triage and diagnostic support network that connects patients with the right care at the right time, while ensuring fairness, transparency, and robust human oversight. Healthcare should be a human right, not a privilege; technology should bridge gaps, not create them; AI should amplify human compassion, not replace it.

### Goals

  * **Bridge Healthcare Gaps:** Offer a readily accessible, baseline triage service via ubiquitous chat platforms, aiming to reduce preventable emergency visits, alleviate pressure on primary care, and improve outcomes from unnecessary in-person consultations, especially for underserved populations (e.g., addressing longer wait times for ethnic minorities and lack of specialist access for rural patients).
  * **Promote Evidence-Based Care:** Implement and continuously update triage and diagnostic support logic based on NICE Clinical Guidelines (e.g., CG95 for chest pain, CG108), MoHFW India protocols, and other credible medical sources for consistent and reliable decision support.
  * **Enable Health System Innovation:** Provide a robust suite of APIs and SDKs to empower telemedicine startups, hospitals, public health agencies, and other third-party applications to integrate Fairdoc‚Äôs triage, diagnostic support, and anonymized data services into their offerings.
  * **Ensure Sustainability & Public Good:** Operate primarily as a non-profit public utility. Funding will be sought through government grants, philanthropic contributions, minimal transaction fees for premium services, and value-added services for institutional partners, modeled after ONDC/UPI funding strategies.
  * **Champion Responsible AI:** Maintain ethical AI principles, including continuous bias monitoring and mitigation (addressing diagnostic bias against ethnicity, gender, age), data privacy, and ensuring human-in-the-loop for all critical medical decisions.

*(Ref: `README.md`, Prompt Vision & Goals)*

-----

## 3\. üë• Target Users & Audience

  * **Primary Users (Patients):** Individuals in the UK and India seeking initial medical guidance or triage for their symptoms, accessible via common messaging apps.
  * **Secondary Users (Healthcare Professionals):**
      * Doctors and specialists using the platform for preliminary case information, patient routing, or second opinions (with patient consent).
      * Public health officials using anonymized data for epidemiological studies and resource allocation.
  * **Tertiary Users (Developers & Institutions):**
      * Third-party developers building health applications.
      * Hospitals and clinics integrating Fairdoc into their workflows.
      * Insurance companies for streamlining pre-authorizations or wellness programs.
      * Pharmaceutical companies and researchers for anonymized data insights (with ethical oversight).

## 5\. üìñ User Story: v0 Prototype - Chest Pain Triage (10-Hour Sprint Focus)

**User:** A patient (e.g., "Alex," 45 years old) experiencing new-onset left chest pain, accompanied by coughing and wheezing. Alex is concerned and decides to use the Fairdoc service via a web interface (Mesop prototype).

**Pre-conditions:**

  * The Fairdoc v0 backend (FastAPI) is running.
  * The Mesop frontend is accessible.
  * Basic infrastructure (PostgreSQL, MinIO, Redis, Ollama with Gemma 4B and mxbai-embed-large) is set up and minimally configured.
  * Pre-programmed questions for chest pain (based on simplified NHS/NICE guidance) are available.
  * Mock `111.json` (non-emergency) and `999.json` (emergency) vector embeddings are pre-loaded in ChromaDB (or a simplified matching mechanism is in place).

**User Journey & Engineering Steps:**

1.  **Initiates Chat (Frontend: Mesop | Backend: FastAPI)**

      * **Alex:** Opens the Fairdoc Mesop web app and starts a new chat session.
      * **System (Mesop UI):** Displays a welcome message and a prompt to describe their main symptom.
      * **Alex:** Types "I have left chest pain with coughing and wheezing."
      * **Engineering (Frontend):** Mesop sends this initial message to the FastAPI backend (`/api/v0/chat/initiate`).

2.  **Initial Symptom Processing & Case Report Creation (Backend: FastAPI, Gemma 4B, Pydantic, PostgreSQL)**

      * **Engineering (Backend):**
          * The FastAPI endpoint receives the message.
          * A **CaseReport Pydantic model instance** is created with a unique `case_id`.
          * The initial message ("I have left chest pain with coughing and wheezing") is **silently processed by Gemma 4B (via Ollama)** to extract initial keywords/symptoms (e.g., "chest pain," "left side," "coughing," "wheezing") and populate relevant fields in the `CaseReport` Pydantic model.
          * The initial `CaseReport` (with `case_id` and extracted symptoms) is **saved to the PostgreSQL `case_reports` table**. Status: "PENDING\_QUESTIONS".

3.  **Guided Questioning (Frontend: Mesop | Backend: FastAPI)**

      * **Engineering (Backend):** Based on keywords like "chest pain," the backend retrieves a **pre-programmed set of questions** (simplified NICE guidance for chest pain first contact).
          * *Search Result for NHS NICE "chest pain first contact questions":* Typical questions involve:
              * **P**rovocation/Palliation: What makes it worse or better?
              * **Q**uality: Describe the pain (sharp, dull, pressure).
              * **R**adiation: Does it spread anywhere? (e.g., arm, jaw, back).
              * **S**everity: On a scale of 1-10, how bad is it?
              * **T**iming: When did it start? Is it constant or intermittent? How long does it last?
              * Associated symptoms: Shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, dizziness, palpitations, fever.
              * For cough/wheeze: Duration, sputum, triggers.
              * Relevant history: Previous heart problems, lung conditions, risk factors (smoking, diabetes, hypertension).
      * **System (Mesop UI):** Displays the first question, e.g., "Can you describe the pain? For example, is it sharp, dull, like pressure, or a burning feeling?"
      * **Alex:** Responds to each question sequentially.
      * **Engineering (Frontend & Backend):**
          * Mesop sends each answer to a FastAPI endpoint (e.g., `/api/v0/chat/continue`).
          * The backend appends the Q\&A to the chat transcript.
          * Gemma 4B continues to **silently listen and update the structured fields** in the `CaseReport` Pydantic model based on Alex's answers.
          * The `CaseReport` in PostgreSQL is updated after each significant answer or batch of answers.

4.  **Optional File Upload (Frontend: Mesop | Backend: FastAPI, MinIO, Celery)**

      * **System (Mesop UI):** After core questions, "Have you had any recent medical reports or a chest X-ray you'd like to share? (Optional)" with an upload button.
      * **Alex:** Chooses to upload a PDF of a recent (mock) ECG report and a JPG of a (mock) chest X-ray.
      * **Engineering (Frontend):** Mesop handles file selection and uploads it to a FastAPI endpoint (e.g., `/api/v0/upload_file`).
      * **Engineering (Backend - FastAPI):**
          * Receives the file.
          * Triggers a **Celery background task** (`upload_to_minio_task`).
      * **Engineering (Celery Worker - `upload_to_minio_task`):**
          * Uploads the file to a **MinIO bucket** (e.g., `fairdoc-casefiles`).
          * Gets the **MinIO URL/object key** for the file.
          * Updates the `CaseReport` in PostgreSQL: adds an entry to an `attachments` field (e.g., a JSON array like `[{"type": "pdf_report", "url": "minio_url_1", "status": "uploaded"}, {"type": "xray_image", "url": "minio_url_2", "status": "uploaded"}]`).
      * **System (Mesop UI):** Shows "File uploaded successfully. We will process it."

5.  **Case Finalization & Initial Notification (Backend: FastAPI, Celery)**

      * **System (Mesop UI):** "Thank you, Alex. We have your initial information. We are now processing your case. You will receive an update shortly."
      * **Engineering (Backend):** Once the standard questions are done and optional files are noted as uploaded, the `CaseReport` status in PostgreSQL is updated to "PROCESSING".
      * A Celery task (`patient_notification_task`) is triggered to (conceptually for v0) send Alex this notification.

6.  **Background Processing - Phase 1: Embedding & Basic Matching (Backend: Celery, mxbai-embed-large, Redis, ChromaDB/PostgreSQL)**

      * **Celery Worker (`process_case_report_task` - Step 1):**
          * Retrieves the finalized `CaseReport` from PostgreSQL.
          * Selected textual fields (chief complaint, key symptoms summary from Gemma 4B) are **vector embedded using `mxbai-embed-large` (via Ollama)**.
          * These embeddings are temporarily **cached in Redis** for quick access during this processing phase.
          * The case embeddings are **matched against pre-loaded vector embeddings** of `111.json` (non-emergency conditions/advice) and `999.json` (emergency conditions) stored in **ChromaDB** (which could use PostgreSQL as a backend or have its vectors mapped to PostgreSQL tables holding the actual text/rules).
          * Matching rule IDs or relevant snippets from `111.json`/`999.json` are added to the `CaseReport` in PostgreSQL (e.g., `matched_protocols: ["chest_pain_protocol_7", "breathing_difficulty_protocol_3"]`).
          * (Simplified for v0): EHR matching is skipped or mocked.

7.  **Background Processing - Phase 2: Multi-modal Analysis (Backend: Celery, OpenCV, SAM2.1 (mocked), Gemma 4B VLM)**

      * **Celery Worker (`process_case_report_task` - Step 2 - for each uploaded image like X-ray):**
          * Retrieves the image file from MinIO using the stored URL.
          * **(Mocked/Simplified for v0):**
              * OpenCV: Basic processing (e.g., load, check dimensions).
              * SAM2.1: Segmentation is conceptual/mocked. Assume a pre-labeled version or skip complex segmentation.
              * Special X-ray model: Not available for v0.
          * **Gemma 4B (VLM capabilities):** The (potentially mock-labeled) image is fed to Gemma 4B to generate a textual description (e.g., "Chest X-ray shows possible opacity in left lower lobe."). This description is added to the `CaseReport` (e.g., `image_analysis: [{"url": "minio_url_2", "description": "...", "status": "analyzed"}]`).
          * The analyzed image (or its labeled version) could be stored back in MinIO with a new link.
      * **(Simplified for v0):** PDF report text extraction (OCR if needed) and analysis is deferred or heavily simplified. If Alex uploaded a PDF, its textual content might be coarsely summarized by Gemma 4B.

8.  **Background Processing - Phase 3: Reasoning & Urgency Scoring (Backend: Celery, DeepSeek/Mistral-like model)**

      * **Celery Worker (`process_case_report_task` - Step 3):**
          * The comprehensive `CaseReport` (now including text Q\&A summaries, 111/999 matches, image descriptions) is fed to a **stronger reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1 14B, Qwen4, or Mistral 13B - simulated via a smaller capable model like Gemma 7B if necessary for speed, or even a well-crafted prompt to Gemma 4B for v0).**
          * The LLM is asked **one critical question**: "Based on this case report, in a normalized X-Y plot where Y-axis is Important/Not-Important (+1 to -1) and X-axis is Urgent/Not-Urgent (+1 to -1), provide a plot coordinate (e.g., {'x': 0.8, 'y': 0.9})."
          * The returned score (e.g., `{'x': 0.8, 'y': 0.9}`) is saved to the `CaseReport` as `urgency_coordinates`. This score implicitly maps to the potential for harm if not addressed swiftly.

9.  **Background Processing - Phase 4: PDF Report Generation (Backend: Celery, ReportLab)**

      * **Celery Worker (`generate_pdf_report_task`):**
          * Retrieves the fully processed `CaseReport`.
          * Uses **ReportLab** to generate a PDF document containing:
              * Patient (Alex's) details (if provided, else anonymous).
              * Summary of chat Q\&A.
              * Key findings from Gemma 4B's initial processing.
              * VLM description of the X-ray.
              * The X-Y urgency/importance score.
              * A brief justification for the assessment (potentially drafted by the reasoning LLM).
          * The generated PDF is **uploaded to MinIO**, and its URL is added to the `CaseReport`. `status` becomes "REPORT\_GENERATED".

10. **Decision & Notification/Escalation (Backend: FastAPI/Celery)**

      * **Engineering (Backend - `final_disposition_task`):**
          * Based on the `urgency_coordinates` (e.g., if X \> 0.7 and Y \> 0.7), the system determines if the case is potentially fatal/highly urgent.
          * **If highly urgent:**
              * The PDF report is **flagged for immediate review by a (mock) doctor** from a `doctors_table` in PostgreSQL (for v0, this is a placeholder).
              * An alert is conceptually sent to this doctor.
              * Alex receives a notification: "Your case has been assessed as requiring urgent attention. We are forwarding your report to a healthcare professional. If you feel your condition is worsening rapidly, please contact emergency services at 999 (UK) / 108 (India)."
          * **If not immediately life-threatening (for v0, assume this path for simplicity of demo):**
              * The PDF report link is sent to Alex via the Mesop interface.
              * A message with **general, safe advice (drafted by the reasoning LLM** during step 8, e.g., "Based on your symptoms, it's important to monitor your condition. Rest, avoid strenuous activity. If pain worsens or you develop new severe symptoms like difficulty breathing, seek medical attention promptly.") is also sent.
      * **System (Mesop UI):** Alex sees the final message, the advice, and a link to download their PDF case report.
      * The `CaseReport` status in PostgreSQL is updated to "COMPLETED\_PATIENT\_NOTIFIED" or "COMPLETED\_ESCALATED".

## 7\. üì¶ Infrastructure & Deployment

*(Ref: Prompt, `Fairdoc_AI_v0 Prototype (10-Hour Sprint).md`)*

### Node Specifications (Target for Scaled Deployment)

  * **Minimum Production Node:**
      * üñ•Ô∏è CPU: 8 vCPUs (x86\_64)
      * üß† RAM: 32 GB DDR4
      * üíæ Storage: 1 TB NVMe SSD
      * üéÆ GPU: CUDA-enabled GPU ‚â•12 GB VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3060/3080/4070, T4)
      * üåê Network: 1 Gbps Ethernet
  * **Local HPC for v0 Prototype (as per user context):**
      * CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X (8c/16t)
      * RAM: 32 GB DDR4
      * GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3060 12 GB
      * Python: 3.12.10 venv

### Deployment Models

  * **Cloud (Target):** Kubernetes cluster (AWS/GCP/Azure) with GPU nodes (e.g., g4dn.2xlarge), control plane nodes (e.g., t3.medium), auto-scaling, managed Redis & PostgreSQL.

The `Fairdoc_AI_v0 Prototype (10-Hour Sprint).md` mentions progress with Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, ChromaDB. This setup should be leveraged/completed.

### Cost Estimates per Node (Illustrative for Cloud)

Certainly! Here's an updated and detailed infrastructure cost breakdown for Fairdoc, incorporating current AWS pricing and additional components:

---

## üí∞ Fairdoc Infrastructure Cost Breakdown (Monthly Estimates)

| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GPU Node**             | 8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM, NVIDIA T4 (16 GB) | \$378 ‚Äì \$530                    | AWS g4dn.xlarge: \$0.526/hr (~~\$378/month); SageMaker: \$0.7364/hr (~~\$530/month)          |
| **CPU Node**             | 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM                    | \$100 ‚Äì \$150                    | Suitable for application server and Celery tasks                                             |
| **Redis Instance**       | 3 GB RAM, 2 vCPU                     | \$50 ‚Äì \$100                     | AWS ElastiCache: \$0.032/hr for cache.t4g.small (\~\$23/month); higher for larger instances  |
| **PostgreSQL Instance**  | db.r5.large (2 vCPU, 16 GB RAM)      | \$200                            | AWS RDS pricing for db.r5.large                                                              |
| **ChromaDB**             | 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM                     | \$100                            | Self-hosted or managed vector database                                                       |
| **MinIO/S3 Storage**     | Variable (storage + egress)          | \$50+                            | Based on usage; AWS S3 pricing applies                                                       |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | Prometheus, ELK Stack                | \$50 ‚Äì \$100                     | Costs for data ingestion and storage                                                         |
| **Bandwidth**            | Variable                             | \$100+                           | Depends on data transfer volumes                                                             |
| **Total Estimated Cost** |                                      | **\$1,028 ‚Äì \$1,330+**           | Excludes potential savings from reserved instances or spot pricing                           |

-----

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Cost Optimization:** Utilizing spot instances or reserved instances can lead to significant savings, especially for GPU nodes.
* **Scalability:** Costs may vary based on usage patterns, data transfer, and storage requirements.
* **Compliance and Security:** Ensure that all components meet necessary compliance standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) and implement robust security measures.

## 8\. üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Guide & API Integration (v1.0 Target)

*(v0 will focus on achieving the user story functionality; full SDKs are for later)*

### Setup & Prerequisites (for v0 on Local HPC)

1.  **Clone Repo (Assume one exists/is created):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> fairdoc_v0
    cd fairdoc_v0
    ```
2.  **Python Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3.12 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Key `requirements.txt` entries for v0: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `sqlalchemy` (for Pydantic-to-DB mapping if not using raw SQL), `psycopg2-binary`, `celery`, `redis`, `minio`, `ollama`, `reportlab`, `mesop`, `google-search-results` (for SerpApi if used for dynamic info, or just `requests`), `torch`, `transformers` (for mxbai if not solely relying on Ollama's embedding endpoint), `opencv-python`, `pydantic>=2.0`.
3.  **Infrastructure Services (Docker Compose - from `Fairdoc_AI_v0 Prototype (10-Hour Sprint).md`):**
      * Ensure `docker-compose.yml` is configured for:
          * PostgreSQL (e.g., `postgres:15`)
          * Redis (e.g., `redis:7`)
          * MinIO (e.g., `minio/minio`)
          * Ollama with Gemma 4B, Gemma 7B (or other reasoning model), mxbai-embed-large pulled.
          * ChromaDB (e.g., `chromadb/chroma`)
      * Start services: `docker-compose up -d`
      * Verify connections (as per `test_connections.py` mentioned in sprint doc).
4.  **Environment Variables (`.env` file):**
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/fairdocdb_v0"
    REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
    MINIO_ENDPOINT="localhost:9000"
    MINIO_ACCESS_KEY="minioadmin"
    MINIO_SECRET_KEY="minioadmin"
    MINIO_BUCKET_NAME="fairdoc-v0-cases"
    OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434" # If Ollama runs in Docker, ensure FastAPI can reach it.
    # Add other necessary configs
    ```
5.  **Run Backend (FastAPI):**
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload 
    ```
6.  **Run Celery Workers:**
    ```bash
    celery -A app.celery_worker.celery worker -l info 
    ```
7.  **Run Frontend (Mesop):**
    ```bash
    mesop app.mesop_app:app
    ```
    Access at `http://localhost:3210` (Mesop default) or as configured.

### Core API Endpoints (Focus for v0)

*(All prefixed with `/api/v0`)*

1.  **`POST /chat/initiate`**:
      * Description: Starts a new chat session for the patient, creates an initial case report.
      * Request Body: `{"initial_message": "I have chest pain..."}`
      * Response: `{"case_id": "uuid", "first_question": "Can you describe the pain?"}`
2.  **`POST /chat/continue`**:
      * Description: Sends subsequent patient responses, gets next question or status.
      * Request Body: `{"case_id": "uuid", "answer": "It's a dull ache."}`
      * Response: `{"case_id": "uuid", "next_question": "...", "status_update": "..."}` or `{"case_id": "uuid", "final_message": "...", "report_link": "..."}`
3.  **`POST /upload_file`**: (Potentially integrated into `/chat/continue` if Mesop handles upload and sends data/reference)
      * Description: Uploads a file (X-ray, PDF) related to a case.
      * Request: `multipart/form-data` with `case_id` and `file`.
      * Response: `{"file_id": "uuid", "minio_url": "...", "message": "File received, processing started."}`
      * *Alternatively, Mesop might upload directly to a pre-signed MinIO URL obtained from backend, then notify backend.*
4.  **`GET /case/{case_id}/status`**:
      * Description: Frontend polls this to get updates on background processing.
      * Response: `{"case_id": "uuid", "status": "PROCESSING_IMAGE_ANALYSIS", "progress_percent": 60}`
5.  **`GET /case/{case_id}/report`**:
      * Description: Retrieves the final PDF report link once ready.
      * Response: `{"case_id": "uuid", "report_url": "minio_url_to_pdf", "advice": "..."}`

*(These are simplified for the 10hr sprint. Full v1 endpoints from prompt for future reference.)*

### SDKs & Libraries (Future v1.0)

  * Python SDK: `pip install fairdoc-sdk`
  * JavaScript SDK: `npm install fairdoc-sdk`

### Chat Platform Connectors (Future v1.0)

  * WhatsApp (Twilio), Telegram Bot, Signal-CLI integration as outlined in prompt.

      * [ ] Define core Pydantic models for `CaseReportV0`, `Attachment`, `ChatInteraction` (as per User Story section).
      * [ ] Define corresponding SQLAlchemy models (or use Pydantic with a simple ORM helper) for PostgreSQL tables: `case_reports`, `attachments`.
      * [ ] Setup basic database connection logic (e.g., in `app/database.py`). Create tables.
      * [ ] Basic `.env` file with DB, Redis, MinIO, Ollama URLs.
      * [ ] `requirements.txt` with essential libraries.
  * **Hour 2: API Endpoints & Initial Chat Flow (60 mins)**
      * [ ] Implement FastAPI endpoint: `POST /api/v0/chat/initiate`.
          * Receives initial message.
          * Creates `CaseReportV0` instance.
          * (Mocked) Calls Gemma 4B (text) via Ollama to summarize initial complaint and store in Pydantic model.
          * Saves to `case_reports` table in PostgreSQL.
          * Returns `case_id` and first pre-programmed chest pain question.

  * **Hour 6: Mesop File Upload & Displaying Questions (60 mins)**
      * [ ] Add file upload component in Mesop UI (using `me.uploader` if suitable or basic HTML input).
      * [ ] On file selection, Mesop calls `/api/v0/upload_file` (or its integrated version).
      * [ ] Ensure Mesop UI correctly displays sequential questions from backend.
  * **Hour 7: Integrating Ollama Calls (Gemma 4B Text & mxbai-embed) (60 mins)**
      * [ ] Flesh out Gemma 4B (text) call in `/chat/initiate` and `/chat/continue` (actual Ollama API call).

          * Prompt for the X-Y urgency/importance coordinate.
          * Prompt for a brief justification and general advice.
          * Update `CaseReportV0`.

-----

**Phase 3: PDF Generation & Final Polish (Est. 2 hours)**

  * **Hour 9: PDF Report Generation (ReportLab) (60 mins)**
      * [ ] Implement Celery task `generate_pdf_report_task`:
          * Retrieve fully processed `CaseReportV0`.
          * Use ReportLab to generate a simple PDF with: Case ID, Initial Complaint, Key Symptoms Summary (from Gemma 4B), X-ray description (from VLM), Urgency Coordinates, Justification, General Advice.
          * Upload PDF to MinIO.
          * Update `CaseReportV0` with PDF URL.

      * [ ] Test the entire user story flow from Mesop chat to PDF report link.
      * [ ] Implement the final decision logic (mocked doctor notification vs. patient report).
      * [ ] Display final advice and PDF link in Mesop UI.
      * [ ] Basic error handling (e.g., if Ollama fails, return a graceful message).
      * [ ] Quick code cleanup and comments.

-----

**Risk Mitigation (from `Fairdoc_AI_v0 Prototype (10-Hour Sprint).md` adapted for this sprint):**

  * **If AI Models Don't Work / Too Slow:** Use rule-based scoring for urgency, pre-programmed responses/PDF content. Mock Ollama calls heavily.
  * **If Mesop is Too Complex:** Fall back to extremely basic HTML forms + FastAPI or even just Postman testing of backend logic.
  * **If File Upload Fails:** Skip file processing for demo; use text-only assessment.
  * **If Time Runs Short:** Focus on core chat flow and mock AI responses. Skip PDF generation, use JSON responses in Mesop. Prioritize backend logic over perfect UI.

*(This 10-hour plan is ambitious. Realistic completion will depend on developer familiarity with tools. Focus on a demonstrable "happy path" for the user story.)*

## 10\. üí∞ Financial Model & Sustainability

*(Ref: Prompt)*

### Funding & Seed Model

  * **Initial Grants & Loans:**
      * India: Seek ‚Çπ100 Cr from government initiatives (e.g., Digital India, MeitY, Health Ministry grants), Development Bank Loans (SIDBI, NABARD).
      * UK: Seek ¬£10 M from UK government (e.g., NHSX, Innovate UK), research councils.
  * **NGO & Foundational Partnerships:** Collaborate with organizations like WHO, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust for pilot programs and research funding.
  * **Venture Philanthropy / Impact Investors:** Attract funding from organizations focused on social impact and public good.

### Service Fees & Premiums

  * **Core Triage (Public Good):** Basic chat-based triage will be **free for individual users** in India and the UK, subsidized by government/grants.
  * **Premium AI Triage (B2B):**
      * Private Providers/Hospitals: Per-assessment fee for advanced multi-modal AI triage (e.g., India: ‚Çπ30‚Äì‚Çπ100/assessment; UK: ¬£2-¬£5/assessment).
  * **Specialist Network Commission (Future):** A small commission (e.g., 5-15%) on teleconsultations successfully booked and completed via the Fairdoc specialist marketplace.
  * **SaaS for Institutions:**
      * Annual subscription fee for hospitals, clinic chains, and insurers for integrating Fairdoc into their workflows, dashboards, and potentially EHRs.
      * India: e.g., ‚Çπ5 Lakh/year per hospital network.
      * UK: e.g., ¬£10k-¬£20k/year per NHS Trust or private hospital group, depending on scale and features.

### Subsidies & Grants (Ongoing)

  * **India UHI Participation:** Potential subsidies for supporting the Unified Health Interface, GPU infrastructure for AI, and deployment in rural/underserved areas (e.g., ‚Çπ50 Cr).
  * **UK NHS Digital / AI Lab Grants:** Ongoing grants for clinical validation, integration with NHS systems, and research on AI in healthcare (e.g., ¬£5 M/year).
  * **Research Grants:** Joint applications with academic partners for research into AI ethics, bias mitigation, and clinical efficacy.

### Value-Added Services (B2B)

  * **Anonymized Analytics & Insights:** Provide aggregated, anonymized, and de-identified health trend data and insights to public health agencies, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies (with strict ethical oversight and data privacy compliance). E.g., India: ‚Çπ20 Lakh/data package.
  * **Insurance Partner Referrals (Ethical):** With user consent, facilitate referrals to insurance partners for relevant health plans or services, potentially earning a small, transparent referral fee.
  * **Clinical Trial Support:** Platform features to assist in identifying and (with consent) recruiting eligible participants for clinical trials.

### Cost Estimates & Break-even Analysis (Illustrative)

*(Using cost estimates from Infrastructure section, highly simplified)*

**Assumptions:**

  * Targeting 1 active operational zone (e.g., a major city or region) initially.
  * Monthly operational cost per zone: \~$1,200 (infra) + staff + R\&D + compliance. Let's assume total ops cost of $20,000/month initially for a lean team and one zone ($240k/year).

**Revenue Projections (Year 2-3):**

  * **Free Triages:** 100,000/month (covered by government/grant subsidy equivalent to operational cost for this service).
  * **Premium Triages:** 20,000/month @ average $2 net revenue = $40,000/month.
  * **Institutional SaaS:** 10 hospitals/institutions @ average $1,000/month ($10k/year each for simplified example) = $10,000/month.
  * **Total Projected Revenue (excluding core subsidy):** $50,000/month.

**Break-even:**

  * If monthly revenue is $50,000 and ops costs are $20,000 (excluding major R\&D scaling), the model shows profitability for premium services.
  * The "free core triage" is the public good aspect, whose costs need to be covered by grants/subsidies. The $200k deficit mentioned in the prompt's example likely refers to the gap if *all* services were initially run without sufficient premium uptake or full subsidy coverage.
  * **Key to sustainability:** Secure foundational government/grant funding for the public good aspect, then scale B2B services to cross-subsidize and fund further innovation. Transparency in annual reports on usage, costs, funding sources, and impact is crucial.
